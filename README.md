# TW Profile in a Static Site

This repository contains the code for the [static site](https://vira-wizeline.github.io/tw-profile/page-two/) about Vira Ivanova, who developed it as the [Final Assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tz_xG8JD6K1xX7LNZpY28QPRyPO_D6FdX_PmZ16XzW0/edit) for the [**DocOps**](https://wizeline.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WTW/pages/2064548146/The+DocOps+Task+Force+Process) training. The information on this site reflects Vira's experience as a Technical Writer (TW).

Vira used the following tools to create the site:
- [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/): To write the pages.
- [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): To edit the content of the pages.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/): To use versioning.
- [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/): To deploy the site.
